## The Philosophy of Open Source Within Institutions for Reconciliation in Colombia
It was the early 2000s, and I was taking my first steps in internet forums. At that time, discussions revolved around Microsoft’s monopoly and its anti-competitive practices, particularly in the realm of web browsers and server operating systems. In this context, the Linux operating system, with distributions like Ubuntu, was beginning to reach a wider audience.

I remember a video that accompanied every Ubuntu installation back then, where Nelson Mandela explained the meaning of the word UBUNTU: “I am because you are.” This message resonated deeply, conveying the essence of community and collaboration that defined Linux’s philosophy, in contrast to more closed models. Ubuntu, as an African philosophy, is rooted in principles of equality, compassion, solidarity, and forgiveness.

I am convinced that an open-source system is essential within the framework of information systems that build memory, especially when dealing with Colombia’s justice and peace system—a space that must foster collaboration and solidarity. This philosophy finds its place when we talk about information systems that organize and catalog documents, forming part of the documentary heritage that contributes to the construction of historical memory in the midst of an ongoing conflict. It is relevant because it establishes a ground where collaboration is possible even when narratives diverge. It is no secret that constructing historical narratives is a contested space, particularly given the circumstances under which we are writing it. Let us allow ourselves the opportunity to propose an open and collaborative project that transcends pre-existing narratives and goes beyond the commercial interests that technological development in the Colombian public sector might represent.

Thanks to the internet, the tools designed for this space have begun to shape the very foundations of our society. Hence the importance of introducing this philosophy into the Colombian public sector—not only for the reasons mentioned above but also due to the urgent need to open these spaces from within the state, which itself is a key actor with multiple implications in the conflict.

Beyond the conceptual and ideological benefits that open-source systems bring to dialogue—especially in the country’s most pressing issue, reconciliation—there are other advantages to using an open system to manage our historical memory. First, an open system allows for open and diverse maintenance. A closed system ties an institution to a specific provider and makes long-term maintenance and updates more difficult. We should understand the free-network aspect of a system with a purpose like memory—not only because the plurality of voices is crucial in constructing memory but also in maintaining and updating the tool that enables us to manage that network. By principle, such tasks should not be controlled by a single provider but should be envisioned as open infrastructure, where contributions from one node benefit the entire network.

Opening the tool not only fosters collaboration and transparency from a technical standpoint but also enhances access to the information stored within it. While all institutional information is public, it is crucial to distinguish between different levels of information classification. Some data cannot be disclosed because, unfortunately, in a country like Colombia, doing so could endanger the lives of those involved. Even if a document’s content cannot be published, its metadata and the fact that it exists should be. This is where system design must incorporate these essential requirements, allowing society or academia to take on an oversight role for the collective benefit.

With this short text, I hope to make a call to apply these philosophies in the Colombian context, particularly in initiatives related to historical memory and the justice and peace system. The proposal for an open and collaborative approach is not just a technical response but a commitment to the plurality of voices, transparency, and accessibility of information. Along this path, we glimpse the possibility of building a digital fabric that not only withstands the test of time and politics but also promotes reconciliation and understanding in a context as complex as Colombia’s. This is an invitation to forge a future where technology serves not only commercial interests but also becomes a tool for empowerment and collective construction.

In the case of Linux and Microsoft, today it is undeniable that the former’s philosophy has played a fundamental role in shaping what we now know as the internet. Microsoft, in turn, has embraced open-source software as one of the pillars in building future systems. This shift in Microsoft’s stance reflects the growing importance and acceptance of open-source software in today’s technological landscape. The coexistence and interaction between these two perspectives serve as an example of how collaboration and openness in the technological realm can lead to significant advances and the evolution of previous paradigms.
