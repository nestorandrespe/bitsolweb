## A Historical Perspective
### Rethinking Coloniality in the Construction of Historical Memory

The construction of historical memory has traditionally relied on archival documents, many of which are not in digital format but exist as physical records safeguarded by institutions responsible for preserving and managing this memory. These institutions, often state-run, have historically reflected colonial narratives deeply embedded in countries like Colombia.

In this text, we will repeatedly examine these practices that perpetuate biased versions of history and cultural narratives, reinforcing power structures and predominantly Eurocentric perspectives. Within this framework, the cultural contributions and lived experiences of Indigenous peoples, Afro-descendant communities, and other marginalized groups are often overlooked and undervalued.

In 2020, we witnessed a global phenomenon in which various statues of conquistadors were taken down by protesters seeking to challenge the established narrative surrounding historical figures who played an oppressive role toward many communities in territories colonized by European countries. Colombia was no exception, as several statues and busts were taken down across the country, sparking intense public debate.

These actions not only questioned the glorification of figures involved in processes of oppression and domination but also encouraged a critical reflection on how official history has been presented and which narratives have been privileged in the country.

Our public spaces, once limited to the physical realm, now extend into the digital sphere, expanding the reach of our public townsquares beyond their physical manifestation. In this modern era, the call to "tear down to heal living memory" must transcend the physical domain and embrace the virtual as well. It is crucial to consider the tools we have at our disposal to dismantle these symbolic statues and what they represent, reflecting on how we can effectively use digital platforms for this task.

In the 21st century, our cultural machines become our most powerful allies in rewriting history in a way that celebrates and acknowledges the richness of cultural diversity. In the following text, we will explore the various ways this process can be carried out, leveraging the opportunities provided by digital technologies and platforms to create a more inclusive and just historical narrative.

## Why Digital?

### The Need to Understand Digital as the Core of Archives and Memory

While we currently have a considerable amount of physical material in our archives, it is crucial to approach this issue with a forward-looking perspective. Observing a timeline, it becomes evident that the period during which we have been producing digital material is significantly shorter compared to the vast history of physical records. However, with the advancement of digital technologies, this trend is set to grow exponentially in a very short time. As we move deeper into an increasingly digital era, the quantity and diversity of digital material will inevitably surpass existing physical records.

In this text, we will focus on the importance of considering memory and archives in their digital format, without disregarding the significance of physical materials. It is essential to recognize that digital storage carries an inherent fragility in the mediums where digital memories are kept. Although efforts are being made to address this fragility, for analytical purposes, we will consider this issue as yet unresolved.

Approaching memory from a digital perspective not only highlights the importance of engaging with new technologies but also underscores their impact on preservation and archiving— even when some of these technologies may be seen as disruptive or problematic. Ignoring or avoiding their presence in this context would be naïve.

New technologies have introduced innovative processes and ways of organizing and accessing information, which can positively transform the preservation and construction of memory.

## "Recognition" and the Systemic Problem
### Why Addressing the Issue Requires a Systemic Approach

With the signing of Colombia’s 1991 Constitution, ethnic groups were formally recognized as rights-bearing subjects. This constitution granted these communities the ability to participate actively in the country's political life, including representation in Congress. Additionally, it acknowledged their autonomy concerning cultural traditions and their deep-rooted connection to ancestral territories.

However, this constitutional recognition reveals a systemic weakness from its inception: the very necessity of granting such recognition. This observation is crucial, as it highlights a reality in which social dynamics rarely adjust on their own without a conscious and explicit act of acknowledgment.

In the virtual realm, where structures and dynamics are more flexible, there is an opportunity to address these issues from a systemic perspective. This space allows for the representation and construction of reality to be designed and reshaped with greater adaptability, fostering platforms and systems that actively promote ethnic and cultural diversity.

The challenge, then, is to conceive historical memory as plural and inclusive, leveraging the malleability of the digital medium. Here, we can lay the foundations for an ecosystem in which narratives intertwine and enrich each other, regardless of their origin.

Precisely for this reason, it is crucial to consider the system as a whole rather than relying on each element in isolation. Returning to the ecosystem analogy, what enables interconnection between trees is not the behavior of each individual tree but the integrity and dynamics of the entire forest.

Similarly, when thinking about the preservation of memory and archives, it is essential to adopt a holistic perspective that considers the entire environment in which these elements operate. This means understanding how various aspects interact, from technologies and storage media to conservation strategies, access policies, and the social dynamics that influence the interpretation, appropriation, and use of historical information. In a forest, it is not just about the trees but about a complex ecosystem involving multiple elements: its inhabitants, natural dynamics, available resources, and ultimately, the system that sustains and enables the existence and evolution of this environment.

The inhabitants of the forest—whether animals, plants, microorganisms, or humans interacting with it—play fundamental roles in its functioning. The interactions between these diverse forms of life, as well as their relationships with available resources such as water, soil, nutrients, and sunlight, are essential for maintaining the balance and health of the ecosystem.

To achieve the goal of integrating new narratives into the official historical record, it is crucial to consider the configuration of the information ecosystem and the implementation of interconnected platforms. Specifically, an open-source system is indispensable for managing memories within institutions such as the National Archives (AGN), the National Center for Historical Memory, or the National Museum. Only through such an approach can new avenues for information exchange be explored between these institutions and others, such as the Museo Afro or civil society organizations committed to fostering and generating memory processes.

## Narrative Interconnection

Starting with open-source foundations is a solid approach to developing a digital archive that encompasses both archival logic and the needs of a museum. Here are key considerations for designing and organizing the archive:

__Archival Logic__ The digital archive must be structured based on solid archival principles, ensuring the organization, classification, and preservation of administrative and management documents within the public institution. This involves implementing metadata standards, classification schemes, and information hierarchy to facilitate document retrieval and understanding.

__Museographic, Educational, Communication, and Research Elements__ Beyond administrative documents, the archive must be able to manage elements specific to museography, such as photographs, videos, exhibition pieces, research, workshop reports, educational materials, and communication resources, among others. It is essential to archive and catalog these materials in an accessible way for future reference and use, whether as inspiration for exhibitions, workshops, or the creation of new narratives.

__Legal and Regulatory Compliance__ Since it is a public institution, the digital archive must comply with legal and regulatory requirements established for document management in government entities. This means maintaining the integrity, authenticity, and accessibility of records, ensuring their long-term preservation and availability for the public and administration. These considerations impact both software and hardware levels.

This exercise must be replicated at each node of the system. Beyond sharing a tool, it is essential to share protocols that define the organization and management of this documentary collection. This first step is key, as the interconnections between different installations of the tool require retrieval based on specific criteria, whether organizational or related to data derived from processing.

Organizing the archive consciously is crucial, considering how the institution operates and conducting a thorough study of the content in collaboration with the institution’s team—in this case, the Museo Afro. Take, for example, the Archivo General de la Nación, where information is classified into Sections, Collections, Files, and finally, Documentary Units. This hierarchical structure provides coherence to archived material and facilitates content searches, from the most general to the most specific. It starts with chronological organization and is then classified thematically, enabling efficient information management.

This is the first stage in building bridges that will help connect all nodes of the network. One initial way an archive can link to another is through collections of interest to a specific party. For instance, in the case of the Museo Afro, using an API key and a dedicated user for this purpose, it is possible to query or "fetch" content from the Archivo General de la Nación (AGN) into the museum’s narratives. It is essential to emphasize that this does not mean disconnecting the material from its origin, as the system is designed to maintain its context. By doing so, rather than simply copying or referencing material, the AGN can track which materials are being consulted and where. This approach turns the bridge into a two-way street, allowing consultations made in other institutions to be visible when accessing that material through the AGN’s tool. Examples of such potential implementations will be addressed later.

The organization of the archive is crucial not only for internal management but also as a starting point for enabling these interconnections between different archives. However, the system’s capabilities go beyond this. The open-source platform must be conceived as an ecosystem—not just because of the opportunities it provides for managing multiple archives, but also for its extensibility and development potential. This is why the open-source approach becomes fundamental in this context. The tool must support the extension of new functionalities or plugins that expand the system's capabilities. These developments do not require re-implementing or financing a new system, as they can leverage existing plugins in addition to the core application that meets basic management needs. These plugins allow file processing and a more automated classification of information.

A clear example is audio and video transcription models. These new developments enable transcribing this material using AI models, providing an additional layer of information: text. In this context, text becomes a representational space where all content can be processed, regardless of its type. For instance, an image can be segmented—identifying and describing the elements it contains in text.

This exercise applies to various document types, such as maps, drawings, or photographs. The task of defining a zone in an image can be applied to any form represented within it. Therefore, the tool must allow tagging across various document types and be designed following the same principle of a common representational space. This ensures that the tool is versatile and adaptable to the specific needs of different content types, facilitating its use across various contexts and applications while leveraging language models to derive meaning from text.

For example, we can describe various types of images using the tool. We can transcribe historical documents by first segmenting the words in the document and tagging each section. Once we have this information, the document becomes searchable, as previously described. With a sufficiently accurate transcription, we can even generate a description of the document using a language model.

The same applies to other document types, such as maps. With the right tool, we can tag specific areas on a map to provide detailed information about locations, geographic features, representation details, or any other relevant aspect that can be encoded as text for search purposes.

We emphasize the importance of having a system capable of understanding and describing all types of content in a uniform manner. This idea is crucial for exploring new ways of connecting information. The goal is to bring all content into a common descriptive format that enables more advanced filtering and search tasks. However, it is essential to recognize that these models require adjustments depending on the type of content being processed. For example, a model designed to analyze medieval documents may not perform as well when applied to colonial-era documents. Therefore, we need a system that allows us to fine-tune these models based on specific needs.

Additionally, sharing these adjusted models and training them with the data we have collected would be highly beneficial. This would enable their use in other locations, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange within our network. Such an approach is only possible within a shared ecosystem—our tool.

Now that we have a system that allows us to represent our documents uniformly and an environment that supports the generation and enrichment of this space, we can explore new ways of accessing information. We no longer need to rely solely on cataloging or archive organization as the primary means of access. Instead, we can retrieve information using the processed text extracted from the archives. This type of search serves a different purpose, and the results can vary significantly. It is essential to understand how this process works and the various ways in which it can be implemented.

On one hand, information retrieval can be conducted through keyword searches. For instance, a keyword search might simply involve typing “cats” into the search engine. In response, the engine will display results that contain the word “cats” in their content.

On the other hand, we have semantic search. Imagine we want to find information about the life expectancy of cats. Instead of searching for “life expectancy of cats” explicitly, we might phrase our query more naturally, such as “How long do cats live on average?” In this case, the search engine does not just look for exact keyword matches but instead interprets the meaning of the query. This involves analyzing the context of the question and understanding the semantics of words to return relevant results, even if they do not contain the exact wording used in the search.

In both cases, information retrieval is performed not only through cataloging metadata but also within the common representational space we have defined—namely, the text extracted from archival materials. This means that the search system is not restricted to keywords found in metadata but also analyzes the textual content of documents to find matches with the query. This broadens the scope of searches and increases the likelihood of finding relevant information for the narratives we aim to construct.

The significance of these bridges goes beyond simply making it easier to retrieve relevant information from an archive for a specific narrative. They also enable us to systematize these queries and make them visible in the source archive. In other words, by integrating these connections from the museum's narratives, we also allow these narratives to be inserted when the material is consulted in the General Archive. This means that not only the documentary resource and its information matter, but also its uses and the connections established through it—highlighting and fostering cultural evolution.

### Autonomous Agents and Why Context Matters

When we talk about autonomous agents within the ecosystem we are developing, we refer to actions that utilize the resources of an archive without being an archive themselves. This makes them essential activators of the network, as the appropriation and activation of this content are fundamental to the ecosystem’s vitality. The tool must be designed to encourage and facilitate these activities while considering the technical requirements necessary for effective implementation in our specific context.

From simplicity arises complexity, and this principle applies perfectly here. The same functionalities we have previously described can be leveraged to activate these agents. Using the API and user accounts, this system can function as a complement to blogging platforms like WordPress. In other words, it is possible to integrate the API of any of the nodes to access that content from a WordPress site. This means we can use cataloging or perform specific searches to display documents in the most suitable way for the web—whether as an image gallery, a mosaic of videos and audios, or other formats depending on the search criteria set.

This option is particularly interesting and once again highlights the benefits of designing these developments in the public sphere as open-source contributions to a shared platform. Initially, these plugins may simply expand the platform’s visualizers and serve as shortcuts to search results. However, by documenting the API and laying the groundwork for its integration with WordPress, new possibilities emerge. This could lead to the development of new viewers, timelines, maps, and other visualizations that utilize archive materials, further enriching the user experience and complementing the narratives implemented on the website.

This application of the API is not limited to WordPress plugins; in fact, access can be used for both virtual reality experiences and messaging platforms. Let’s explore both cases with examples.

In the first case, consider a film as a reference—After Yang, directed by Kogonada. Imagine a virtual reality experience inspired by this film, where viewers can explore archive resources represented as point clouds that, in turn, form a forest of memories. This interface is controlled using the voice of the character.

In the context of messaging platforms, imagine a user searching for information on a specific topic who needs quick access to related documents or resources. By integrating the API into messaging applications, the user can instantly receive the top results of a query or systematically organize content into a specific archive section for various activities. This can happen in two ways:

The user can perform a direct query from the messaging application, either as a free search or based on specific questions. For example, they might type, "I need information on the history of Colombia’s independence," and receive a response with links to relevant documents or excerpts of related texts.
During an in-person interaction, such as a workshop or a visit to the museum's physical space, users could pose questions that are addressed through a workshop led by the museum team. For example, during a guided tour, the guide could organize a complementary workshop to the exhibition and record the responses in the system for future use. Visitors could even receive a digital keepsake at the end of their visit in the form of a message on their phone.

The innovative use of these messaging applications arises from a conscious understanding of the national context, where a large number of people already own mobile devices and regularly use these applications. It is crucial to consider the tool’s development on a local level since context shapes how it is employed. While there are numerous examples of similar implementations worldwide, in this case—especially regarding information access—a localized analysis is required to understand the dynamics that best fit the country’s reality.

## New Horizons
### From the Elementary to the Complex

At this point, the conceptual and technical framework of the tool as a system has been established. Now, it is time to consider the possibilities that arise. Just as a tool can inspire new interpretations and variations, the system we have outlined opens new horizons based on its elementary functionalities.

The tool allows for the cataloging of information following predefined rules while also being adaptable enough for each institution to define the structure and hierarchy of information according to its specific needs. This enables content exploration by themes, revealing not only the internal organization of the archive but also highlighting what is missing, depending on how the content is used and called upon.

### AI and the Improvement of Transcription Models

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) models as complements to the tool, along with its ability to process and systematize new information, paves the way for training specialized models. While much is said about biases in AI models, the core issue does not lie in the model itself but in the training data that feeds it. The solution to this problem begins with tools that enable the generation and systematization of more representative training data.

In our case, we could focus on improving transcription models to better recognize the accents and regionalisms of diverse communities across the country. This effort represents an attempt to “listen to ourselves better.” This task can be carried out through the tool, leveraging information systematization and its integration with messaging applications.

### Search and Narrative: An Evolving Ecosystem

Search, with its various levels of complexity—whether keyword-based or semantic—marks the beginning of a path that branches out in multiple directions. The ability to transcribe, combined with a text-based interface, allows for a conversational interaction in these queries, strengthening the narratives that the museum seeks to communicate through its curatorial work.

However, beyond the tool’s capabilities, it is crucial to remember that the key lies in the narrative to be conveyed and how these functionalities can contribute to that purpose. The way results are presented should align with the curatorial intent of the museum exhibition. These results can take various forms:

Simulated conversations through text messages using language models trained for this purpose.
Digital galleries displaying results on a specialized website.
Interactive experiences featuring projections in physical spaces or virtual environments using VR devices.
By having the ability to receive not just a link as a result, but also an image of the referenced page, the image itself, or video and audio fragments, the task of interpretation and narrative depends on the way the query is made, the context in which it is conducted, and the manner in which it is visualized. All of this can be achieved through basic and accessible functionalities, provided the right tool is in place.

Final Reflection: Redefining the Narrative
When we initially discussed statues and their significance, we emphasized the importance of the act of toppling them within the context in which that action takes place. The same applies to the virtual realm. Knocking down these statues is not just about doing so in a video game, but about considering this action systemically. By doing so, we redefine the very means that construct narratives, and only then can we subvert them.
