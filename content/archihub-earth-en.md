# Orbital Data: Towards Earth Awareness Through Natural Memory

Throughout history, our world has hosted a rich collection of stories and narratives. From objective and scientific interpretations to divine personifications, the narratives exploring the origins of Earth and our role in the vast universe have been numerous. This project undertakes the task of weaving a unique narrative around the planet, understanding it as an entity with its own consciousness, not just for understanding but also to forge intimate connections with that mass floating in space.

In Stanisław Lem's work, "Solaris," an alien form of life is illustrated in the form of an entire planet. Scientific teams orbit this enigmatic world, observing its movements in an attempt to comprehend it. Similarly, our planet is a subject of study with the presence of numerous orbital artifacts. The main distinction lies in the specific purpose for which these satellites collect data.

However, what if we strive to perceive Earth as a singular and conscious entity, similar to the approach taken with Solaris? There is no consciousness without memory. Yet, a memory oriented towards the future is needed—a meticulous collection of satellite and collected sensor data deposited in an archive that begins to weave a narrative: a chronicle of the planet and the extraordinary singularity it embodies.

When we contemplate what memory means for a human being, the answer lies in the brain's capacity to retain and retrieve information. However, delving into a deeper perspective, we can link this data storage to the very construction of our identity. Memory is not just a record of facts; it is also the fabric that shapes who we are. Memory constructs an identity.

If we now consider memory or the action of storing information from a technical perspective and in terms of computer systems, we can understand memory as the result of efficient organization, cataloging, processing, and conservation of data in a complex framework. This framework can be accessed in various ways and through different parameters, whether by date, location, color, frequency, semantics, among others.

By constructing a memory, we forge an identity. And by building the tools that empower us to explore that memory, we open the door to the possibility of creating awareness around the narrative we are weaving. We could see it in the following way: by memorizing, we are creating, and by remembering, we reinforce that act of creation by using the narrative as a vehicle to evoke the emotions of the one recalling.

There are ways to employ digital media that establish a dialogue with the viewer, but these digital visualizations remain incomplete and underutilized if we do not consider these experiences in a physical space. It is in this other dimension that new channels of information come into play, which can connect more effectively on an emotional level. The spatiality of a body in space, the sounds that envelop it, the journey and movement in three-dimensionality reinforce projections and interactives, creating a more enriching experience.

This proposal is approached from two perspectives: a digital one, where we seek to build an archive that allows us to collect, organize, and process data about Earth, and on the other hand, an installative one, in which we will use those memories we have organized to transform them into an intimately interactive and sensory experience with space.
