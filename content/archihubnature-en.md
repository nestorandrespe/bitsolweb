# Archihub for nature

### It might seem unusual to think of a document management system as a versatile tool for capturing data in the wild, but thatâ€™s exactly what ArchiHUB offers.

### Because it was designed as a system that seeks to encompass the entirety of memory as the foundation for an artistic project, ArchiHUB recognizes that memory is not exclusively human. By organizing and systematizing data from nature, we weave a narrative and build a natural memory.

### We are currently working on applications for small weather stations and hydroponic crops. We have integrated ArchiHUB for data collection, processing, and publication through instant messaging applications.

### As we progress, we will implement more details about the possibilities. In the meantime, you can check out the following post, which conceptually describes the purpose of this project.
