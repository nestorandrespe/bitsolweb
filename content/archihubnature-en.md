# Archihub for nature

### It might seem unusual to think of a document management system as a versatile tool for capturing data in the wild, but that’s exactly what ArchiHUB offers.

### ArchiHub allows you to connect a wide range of sensors to collect information, as well as interfaces that enable you to take actions in the real world—all directly from the application. A simple and practical way to bridge the digital and physical worlds!

### At ArchiHub, we understand that memory is more than just recording and archiving—it’s about how we put it into action. That’s why we offer plugins that let you interact with real-world interfaces, whether to capture information or activate motorized systems. A simple and effective way to bring your data to life and connect with your environment!

### Designed as a system that seeks to encompass memory in its entirety as the foundation of an artistic project, ArchiHUB recognizes that memory is not exclusively human. By organizing and systematizing data from nature, we weave a narrative and build a natural memory.

### We are currently working on applications for small weather stations and hydroponic crops. We have integrated ArchiHUB for data collection, processing, and publication through instant messaging applications

### As we progress, we will implement more details about the possibilities. In the meantime, you can check out the following post, which conceptually describes the purpose of this project.
