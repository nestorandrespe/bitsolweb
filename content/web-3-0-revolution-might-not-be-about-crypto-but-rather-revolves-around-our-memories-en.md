# Web 3.0 revolution might not be about crypto, but rather revolves around our memories

#### Néstor Andrés Peña

The supposed crypto revolution, exemplified by the recent crashes of Luna and FTX, may have pushed us to a re-evaluation of that so called web 3.0. Recent headlines in AI indicate that it may soon revolutionize the way we navigate and make sense of the vast amount of information we have uploaded to the internet throught the years and the importance of how we explore it and preserve it in the years to come.

## The problem

The innovation of the crypto market in the financial system is a fascinating topic and there is no doubt about that, althought some may [argue otherwise](https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-07-07/jorge-stolfi-technologically-bitcoin-and-blockchain-technology-is-garbage.html). This new system represents a clever method of transforming the currency from a faith-based community to an algorithmic value system, as stated by [Ed Finn in “What Algorithms Want”](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262536042/what-algorithms-want/). My problem with it is not the technology behind it but the expectations put to it as this new wave of internet revolution.

`“In the fields of history and political science, a revolution is a radical change in the established order, usually the established government and social institutions. Typically, revolutions take the form of organized movements aimed at effecting change — economic change, technological change, political change, or social change.” National Geographic`

Undoubtedly, there are still numerous useful, untapped and undiscovered applications for crypto technology in our society and the growing digital landscape. However, right now, the so-called revolution appears to be far from what it purports to be. The headlines surrounding it suggest more of a financial bubble than a genuine disruptive force.

This is not the case for all the recent AI development, more specificaly in the search space of the internet. And I believe there is a reason for it that goes beyond our natural fascination with machines that can talk like humans; it is rooted in what defines us as human beings: our memories. Let me explain.

## The context

By definition, technology is constantly changing and improving and the internet is no exception. We’ve tried to categorize those changes into what we’ve called the Web 1.0 and 2.0.

The initial iteration of the internet was a static and straightforward method of disseminating information via a network accessible to all. This represented a revolutionary development, and with a basic HTML document, we could publish any information we desired, provided we had access to a server. Of course, not everyone was willing to go through the hassle of setting up a server, prompting the internet to evolve into a collaborative tool for making information accessible through blogs, social media, and platforms like Wikipedia. This represented the second revolution, and it was a remarkable one. Instead of solely consuming content, everyone became a creator, uploading articles, podcasts, videos, pictures, and more. And we are still undergoing changes today that are directly linked to the ripples caused by this revolution.

I’m convinced we shouldn’t look to far to uncover the third revolution: the way in which we access the vast amounts of information that we have collectively amassed online over the past few years, as well as the data that we will continue to upload in the years to come.

But haven’t we already learned how to explore it? That’s why Google is Google afterall.

Yes, but let’s dig deeper.

## The search revolution

Today, a clash of titans is unfolding before our eyes. As Satya Nadela, CEO of Microsoft, puts it: “I have not seen something like this since I would say 2007–2008, when the cloud was just first coming out”. And he’s not wrong.

Althought it may seem that the supremacy of Google is being challenged just now by the recent rise of chatGPT in Bing, it’s something that’s happening for some time now. Many users have begun to notice that Google’s effectiveness has declined in some searches, with Reddit suddenly providing better answers, and even TikTok becoming a more reliable source of information on certain topics.

The significance of this battle lies not only in the emergence of new contenders, but more importantly in the recognition that the battleground is the content itself. Our collective memories represent the most valuable asset of this revolution. As Jack Dorsey puts it:

`“The internet is trending towards a world were storage is “free” and infinite, which places all the actual value on how to discover and see content.”`

The rise of user-generated content has caused us to re-examine what we had previously taken for granted; the notion that a single search engine could reign supreme may no longer be accurate. With chatGPT starting to role out on Bing, it shows us in fact that it’s posible. With the abundance of content, we must begin considering alternative methods for navigating and organizing it. As time progresses, we will rely less on physical archives to learn about our history or discover hidden truths, and instead rely on digital files and indices to navigate the wealth of information available to us.

At the national level, it is imperative that we begin contemplating the development of open tools to enhance our archives and enable us to better preserve and explore our memories and knowledge.

## How search

How exactly does AI assist us in improving and navigating through vast amounts of data? There are various ways it can contribute, and we can discuss some of them that will be useful for future tools:

__Data processing__: right now we have access to a range of models that aid in extracting information from our files. These include document segmentation and OCR for accurate extraction of text from documents, as well as efficient transcription of audio and video content. Additionally, Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as effective tools for summarizing and categorizing extracted texts. Employing these tools enables us to better organize and classify information within our archival systems, thereby enhancing our search capabilities.

__Semantic search__: semantic search offers a wealth of possibilities once we have textual data at our disposal. Among the most compelling options is the ability to locate files based on semantics rather than keywords alone. While a general semantic model can generate embeddings useful for retrieving similar information, these models can also be fine-tuned for specific contexts, provided there is thorough research and rigorous effort involved in their development and implementation.

## Not just search

Artificial intelligence is not only shaping new approaches to exploration and search, but with the advent of more generative models, it is also threatening the future of our content generation. We are rapidly approaching an era where AI-generated content will surpass user-generated content, and this may prove to be a precarious place.

The humble archive (arche in greek means [a first principle from which other principles are derived](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arche)) may not only serve as a repository for our documents and history, but also act as a guardian of our human memories. The significance of this role may be greater now than ever before, emphasizing the urgency of establishing the groundwork for tools that enable us to fulfill it.

It might not look like it right now but I firmly believe this upcoming revolution isn’t about financial systems, or even search. Rather, it is about us — our memories, our knowledge, and our humanity.
