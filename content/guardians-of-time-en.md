# Guardians of Time: Digital Tools, Knowledge, and Traditional Practices

## Thinking of a Knowledge Network from a Digital Humanities Perspective

When we refer to traditional knowledge, we are talking about wisdom passed down through generations, continuously adapting to the environment in which it emerges. This knowledge can encompass anything from hunting or farming techniques to the use of medicinal plants and a deep understanding of the relationship between people and nature. For example, in Colombia, there are the Guardianes de Semillas (Seed Guardians), who dedicate themselves to preserving and organizing native and heirloom seeds. Beyond safeguarding the seeds, they also protect the knowledge associated with their cultivation, preservation, and adaptation to the specific climatic variations of each region.

The role of a digital archive designed for historical memory becomes particularly relevant in the context of these knowledge systems. However, the ways in which users interact with the archive must be tailored to local usage patterns, especially regarding how information is uploaded by users. In this scenario, language models and transcription tools can be leveraged to enhance WhatsApp/Telegram groups or conversations, turning them into effective channels for data collection through oral knowledge transfer.

These protocols must be adapted to each community and location in a specific way. It is crucial to conduct workshops where participants can identify key topics or themes of interest in the stories they share. One example of this approach was implemented with IDARTES and a network of urban gardens in Bogotá. To ensure the system’s effectiveness, participants need to define the key topics in the stories they wish to share. In the case of urban gardens, this could include community processes, types of crops they grow, people involved, and the seeds they use. The challenge lies in establishing a common framework that defines what we aim to encode into language—while acknowledging that not everything can be codified. On the other hand, spoken dialogue itself is essential to this proposal, as it is the fundamental way we relate to and understand each other as a community. It allows us to think narratively about a shared goal.

The effectiveness of cataloging and organizing these memories largely depends on this process. The configuration and programming of the language model responsible for processing these transcribed texts—whether from audio or video—are based on the dialogue generated and the interests expressed by the communities. The way each participant narrates their story is also fundamental. It could be through an individually recorded audio file, a video describing a specific space, or a roundtable-style recording where multiple participants establish discussion rules, and all interventions and dialogues are recorded.

The central issue is how a tool designed to organize historical memory can not only help us gain a deeper understanding but also identify common themes across these narratives. Once these meetings and dialogues have been systematized, the question arises: what navigation paths can we use with a tool that allows us to explore the content we have encoded? Considering this challenge in contexts where the connection between humans and nature is central provides an opportunity to later extrapolate it to other scenarios and scales.
