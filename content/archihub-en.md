# What is Archihub?

### ArchiHUB is a Colombian open source application that seeks to weave narratives through the systematization of information, either with institutional documents, historical archives or natural data.

### Its goal is to help users better understand complex data and visualize connections between different pieces of information.

### Thanks to its high flexibility, compatibility with services such as AWS S3, Python plugin ecosystem and robust database management, ArchiHUB facilitates long-term digital preservation.

### Due to its conceptual origins and its focus on historical memory as a subject of study in the digital realm, ArchiHUB is seen as an artistic project that sparks debates around the narratives that collectively shape a central idea.
