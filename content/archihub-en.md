# What is Archihub?

### ArchiHUB is a Colombian open source application that seeks to weave narratives through the systematization of information, either with institutional documents, historical archives or natural data. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/Archihub-App) and the [oficial documentation](https://archihub-app.github.io/archihub.github.io/en/) to know more!

### It combines all types of information, from structured data to free text, as well as data collected from sensors or extracted from natural systems and conversations, such as Telegram chats. This is all made possible through its practical plugins. Additionally, ArchiHub is largely open-source, allowing you to use it on your own computer or server and easily create a customized API. A flexible solution to manage your information your way!

### ArchiHub is designed to organize your information efficiently while also helping you weave stories with it. You can use our free interface to get started easily or, if you prefer, design your own interfaces to interact with your files and share them however you like. You decide how to bring your data to life!

### ArchiHub is born from a unique vision and a passion for historical memory in the digital world, making it much more than just a toolâ€”it is an artistic project. It invites reflection and discussion on how collective narratives can come together to build a powerful and shared idea. A creative way to explore the past and present!
