## Beyond the Functional and Technical Requirements of the Application

We may have become so accustomed to it that we don’t even realize it, but today, many of the processes shaping our reality are digitized. We could say that a part of our daily lives has migrated to the digital realm, where organization and management become easier. From the implementation of management systems in libraries to technologies that digitize trust in financial systems, these are all examples of this trend.

It is true that our image archives on mobile devices, as well as our social media profiles, can be considered systems that organize our memory in a certain way. For example, when we want to recall images from trips or events, we often turn to our phone’s gallery, which stores our photos in the cloud and allows us to explore them in various ways—chronologically, filtered by person, location, and more.

However, it is important to reflect more deeply on what memory truly means in order to design a system that effectively organizes it.

## About "memory"

When we refer to memory in the singular, are we really talking about a single, unified entity? This question leads us to reconsider our understanding of memory and its implications in the design of a system intended to organize it. To explore this, it is essential to consider narrative structures. In the film Waltz with Bashir, for instance, the protagonist describes how memory is a subjective and ever-changing process—a narrative that adjusts as a person changes, experiences new events, and evolves.

Memory is not an objective process but rather a complex network of interwoven, interrupted, edited, and evolving narrative threads. By referring to narratives in the plural, we acknowledge that memory is not limited to a single story but instead encompasses the accumulation of all these interconnected narratives. Since memory can be rewritten and adapted, any system designed to manage and organize it must be built on this dynamic and flexible principle. Singular memory comprises the entirety of narrative threads, whether they converge or diverge.

The plural nature of memory implies recognizing the processes that shape it and finding ways to integrate them into the system. On one hand, there is the process of memorization, which involves creating new narrative threads—either from new experiences or by reconfiguring existing ones to form something new. Understanding that these narrative formations are highly flexible, much like how our brain processes and recalls information, is crucial. Therefore, designing a digital system means attempting to simulate and reflect this process in an effective and dynamic way. On the other hand, the process of remembering is essential for building memory and shaping our interaction with it. This is where the system must provide effective means of engaging with memory—allowing users to explore and navigate different narrative threads. This exploration can take simple navigation forms, such as general thematic classifications, or more complex approaches that use language models to interpret these narratives and identify points of convergence.

## The System

ArchiHUB aims to capture the complexity of memory, as discussed, and translate it into a digital system that acknowledges and enhances its diverse facets, generating real-world impact through concrete processes that emerge from the digital space. From a technological perspective, this platform must be conceived as an open-source system. It should include fundamental features for cataloging and managing a digital archive, such as handling archived resources with diverse metadata types, configuring hierarchical information structures, and supporting multiple file formats. Additionally, it must allow for core system extensions to integrate future functionalities or new processing models. ArchiHUB already incorporates these core features along with a suite of extensions for common tasks such as automatic transcription and image segmentation.

Memory is divided into two parts: memorization and recollection. Regarding memorization, this refers to cataloging, which can be integrated into the tool in various ways. On one hand, it can be a manual and rigorous cataloging process, following established archival protocols to organize metadata and information. On the other hand, there is the possibility of systematizing information through an automated system defined based on specific workshops or activities. For example, if we want to document oral histories from knowledge bearers, we can use the system to receive and transcribe audio recordings sent via WhatsApp during in-person workshops. In these sessions, each participant would share their story individually or in groups, following predefined narrative structures based on the goals of that memorization process.

Recollection, on the other hand, refers to the different ways of accessing stored memories. This aspect is tied to the various methods of visualizing and retrieving archived information within the tool. ArchiHUB provides a default administration interface that allows users to conduct multiple types of queries and manage information. These visualization options serve as an initial framework for utilizing the data stored within ArchiHUB and are designed to be compatible with a wide range of content.

However, ArchiHUB does not intend to be the sole means of interacting with the documentary collection. The platform offers a public API that requires user registration and provides multiple access points for querying information. These allow not only content retrieval but also advanced search and data exploration functionalities. Such capabilities enable the development of experiences for web platforms, virtual reality, and even gaming environments.

This flexibility in accessing information is crucial because the processes of remembering within memory must be adaptable to diversify access and facilitate new interpretations and appropriations of our memories.web-3-0-revolution-might-not-be-about-crypto-but-rather-revolves-around-our-memories
